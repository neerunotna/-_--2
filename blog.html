                    <p>My Experience of a One-Month Internship in Web Development at Oasis Infobyte

                        Recently, I had the opportunity to complete a one-month internship in web development at Oasis Infobyte. It was an amazing experience that allowed me to work on real projects and improve my skills in web development. In this blog post, I'll share my experience and the three main tasks I worked on during my internship.
                        
                        Task 1: Designing a Landing Page
                        
                        The first task I was assigned was to design a Landing Page for a client. I was given a brief and a set of requirements, and I had to come up with a design that met the client's needs. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the website, and I made sure that it was responsive and looked great on all devices.
                        
                        This task taught me a lot about design principles, user experience, and how to work with a client to create a website that meets their needs. 
                        
                        Task 2: Developing a Portfolio Website
                        
                        For my second task, I was asked to develop a Portfolio Website for anyone. I used Html,Css and JavaScript to create the website, which allowed the client to easily manage their website content.
                        
                        This task taught me a lot about web development and how to work on a project on time. I also learned about the importance of documentation and testing to ensure that the plugin works as expected.
                        
                        Task 3:Design a Simple Temperature Converter
                        
                        The third task I worked to design a Simple Temperature Converter website.
                        
                        Overall, my internship at Oasis Infobyte was a great learning experience. I was able to work on real projects, learn from experienced developers, and improve my skills in web development. I would highly recommend this internship to anyone who wants to gain practical experience in web development and work with a team of experts in the field.</p>
